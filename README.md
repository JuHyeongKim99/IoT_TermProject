# IoT_TermProject
2022-1 Sensor and Wireless (IoT) Term Project

Objective

Currently, students of Gachon Dept. of AI-SW needs space for multiple team-project subjects. 
However, Gachon AI-engineering-building has not enough space to hold hundreds of AI-SW students progressing 6+ team projects each. 
This is why students are conducting team project meetings in emptied classrooms these days.

As there are some classrooms without proper time schedule table paper (with wrong, outdated information, or even with no time schedule table paper), there might be concerning of conflicts between students and professor, school staff of using emptied classroom.

This project is meant to provide exact information of the classroom for students who are inside that classroom.
